ToDo List Web Application


overview:


Hello there! This is my ToDo list web application that I've built to help you manage your tasks and stay organized. It's designed with simplicity and user-friendliness in mind.


Key Feature:


1.Title and Icon:

Right at the top, you'll see the title "My ToDo-s" along with a nifty checkbox icon. This icon represents the status of your tasks, whether they're completed or not.

2.Add Task Bar:

Input Field: In the middle of the screen, there's a handy input field labeled "Add New Task." This is where you can enter your new tasks.
Add Button: Right next to the input field, there's a button that says "Add." Clicking this button will add your task to the list.

3.Task List:

Heading: Below the input field, you'll find a heading that says "Task-list." It's styled with the "Maven Pro" font to give it a neat look.
List: Your tasks are displayed as a list (ul) with the class "task-list." Each individual task is an item in this list (li).

4.Task Elements:

Checkboxes: Every task comes with a checkbox input. Just click a checkbox to mark your task as completed or incomplete.
Task Text: The task description is displayed right beside the checkbox as regular text.
Delete Icon: For each task, there's a little "x" icon (styled with the "bx bx-x bx1" class) on the right side. Click this icon to delete a task.

Javascript Functionality:


*Adding Tasks: When you hit the "Add" button, my JavaScript magic kicks in! It creates a new task item (li) and adds it to your list. Plus, it's kind enough to clear the input field afterward.

*Checking and Unchecking Tasks: Clicking a checkbox toggles the completion status of your task. You'll notice that completed tasks get a line-through style and a different text color.

*Deleting Tasks: If you've finished a task or want to get rid of one, just click that delete icon, and poof! It disappears from your list.

*Event Handling: Thanks to JavaScript, I've added some nifty event listeners to handle your clicks on checkboxes and delete icons.


Styling and Design:


*I've put a lot of effort into making this application look appealing and easy to use. The color scheme is carefully chosen to make it easy on the eyes.

*Your tasks are neatly organized with checkboxes, task descriptions, and delete icons, so everything is clear and accessible.

*I've paid attention to spacing and alignment to make sure the design is both functional and visually pleasing.


Conclusion:

I hope you find my ToDo list web application helpful! It's a showcase of my JavaScript skills, demonstrating my ability to create interactive and dynamic elements for practical use. Feel free to try it out and stay organized!
